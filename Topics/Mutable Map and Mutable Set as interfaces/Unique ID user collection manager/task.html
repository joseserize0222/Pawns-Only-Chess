This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</p></div><p>Write a program that maintains a collection of users where each user has a unique identifier. Manage the collection by adding new users with unique integers as their IDs and user names as Strings. If a user tries to add a user with an ID that already exists, your program should print 'ID exists'. Provide the functionality to also remove a user by their ID. The program should process a series of inputs representing the command ('add' or 'remove'), followed by the user ID, and for 'add' operations, the user name. The program ends when the input command is 'end'. After the final command, print out the remaining user IDs and names in the order they were added. Inputs consist of command ID pairs or command ID name triples, separated by spaces. Outputs should be the available user IDs and names after all operations, one per line, or 'ID exists' where appropriate.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">add 1 Alice<br>add 2 Bob<br>add 1 Charlie<br>remove 2<br>end</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">ID exists<br>1 Alice</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">add 3 Eve<br>remove 3<br>add 4 David<br>end</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4 David</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
