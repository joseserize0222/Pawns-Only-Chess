<p>You already know quite a lot about <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/14633" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. | It is used to perform various operations on a text, such as searching, editing, or manipulating text based on certain patterns. Regular expressions can include special characters that have a specific meaning, like the dot character (.) that matches any single character, the question mark (?) that indicates optionality, or the escape character (\) that allows you to include special characters literally. In the context of the provided text, groups are an essential concept for creating complex regular expressions. Groups are created by enclosing a part of a regular expression in parentheses, allowing you to set a new priority for operations and apply quantifiers to the entire content of the bracket.">regular expressions</a></strong>. In this topic, we will take a broader look at how they are used, particularly, with the <code class="language-kotlin">split</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">replace</code> functions.</p>
<p>Using regexps in these methods allows us to describe a wider group of text elements. You will appreciate the efficiency of this approach!</p>
<h5 id="regexps-and-split">Regexps and split()</h5>
<p>You are already familiar with <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> from the topics in which we discussed string processing. Let's quickly recap what it is.</p>
<p>This method is used to split a string into parts according to a certain principle: the argument of <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> defines the sequence of characters around which the string is split. The result of <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> is a list of strings containing parts of the original string. So let's see what the overloaded  <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> method with the use of regular expressions looks like. You will see that it is quite similar!</p>
<p>The definition looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun CharSequence.split(
    regex: Regex,
    limit: Int = 0
): List</code></pre>
<p>Let's consider the arguments. The <code class="language-kotlin">regex</code> argument is responsible for the regular expression which defines the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/14633" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a delimiter is a character or a sequence of characters that separates the elements of a string. | It is used to split a string into substrings based on the specified delimiter. The default delimiter is a whitespace. By customizing the delimiter, you can read data differently. For instance, you can use a comma or a colon as a delimiter to read words or integer values separately. The `split()` function is used to divide a string into substrings by a separator, and it returns a list of those substrings.">delimiter</a>, and <code class="language-kotlin">limit</code> sets the maximum number of substrings to return. Zero by default means no limit is set.</p>
<p>So, <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> splits the input char sequence around the matches of a given regular expression.</p>
<h5 id="regexps-and-split-example">Regexps and split(): example</h5>
<p>If you remember, in previous topics we looked at an example of using <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> in phone number splitting. We split an American phone number into its country code, area code, central office code, and other remaining digits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number = "+1-213-345-6789"
val parts = number.split("-") // {"+1", "213", "345", "6789"}</code></pre>
<p>Now let's make the previously considered problem more complex. There may be parentheses in the number. Or there may be none. We need to cover both of these cases.</p>
<p>This is where regular expressions help us! Let's compose a regular expression that will match either the separator "<code class="language-kotlin">-</code>", or "<code class="language-kotlin">-(</code>", or "<code class="language-kotlin">)-</code>". We will use <code class="language-kotlin">toRegex()</code> to create a regular expression from a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">"(-\\(|\\)-|-)".toRegex()</code></pre>
<p>Let's check the method for both variants of number spelling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number = "+1-213-345-6789"
val brackets = "+1-(213)-345-6789"
// splitting all substrings in number with brackets
val splitBrackets = brackets.split("(-\\(|\\)-|-)".toRegex()) // {"+1", "213", "345", "6789"}
// splitting only two substring
val splitFirstBrackets = number.split("(-\\(|\\)-|-)".toRegex(), 2) // {"+1", "213-345-6789"}
// splitting all substrings in number without brackets
val splitNumber = number.split("(-\\(|\\)-|-)".toRegex()) // {"+1", "213", "345", "6789"}</code></pre>
<p>Everything works!</p>
<h5 id="regexps-and-replace">Regexps and replace()</h5>
<p>Let's look at the use of regexps with another method: <code class="language-kotlin">replace()</code>. As you may remember, this method is used to replace some parts of the original string with new ones:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun String.replace(
    oldValue: String,
    newValue: String,
    ignoreCase: Boolean = false
): String</code></pre>
<p>Accordingly, we can either define the desired parts of the string directly as another string or cover more cases using a regular expression.</p>
<p>Let's look at the overload of <code class="language-kotlin">replace()</code> for regular expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun CharSequence.replace(
    regex: Regex,
    replacement: String
): String</code></pre>
<p>As arguments, it accepts <code class="language-kotlin">regex</code>, which searches for replaceable parts in the text, and the string with which they will be replaced.</p>
<h5 id="regexps-and-replace-example">Regexps and replace(): example</h5>
<p>So, let's look at an example of using <code class="language-kotlin">replace()</code> with regexp. </p>
<p>Suppose we have a text in which we need to replace all the digits with the string "[digits]". It will be difficult to define exactly what we want with one string. But with regular expressions, everything is solved very easily:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val withDigits = "The first test flight of Falcon 9 was on June 4, 2010, " +
        "from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the first resupply mission " +
        "to the ISS was made on October 7, 2012."
val processedString = withDigits.replace("\\d+".toRegex(), "[digits]")</code></pre>
<p>It's easy to see that regex <code class="language-kotlin">\\d+</code> matches all occurrences of one or more numbers in the text. </p>
<p>As a result of executing the code above, the following text will be stored in <code class="language-kotlin">processedString</code>:</p>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">The first test flight of Falcon [digits] was on June [digits], [digits], from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the first resupply mission to the ISS was made on October [digits], [digits].</code></p>
<p>As you can see, all the numbers in the text have been replaced with the specified string.</p>
<h5 id="find-and-findall">find() and findAll()</h5>
<p>Let's take a look at two more functions that will definitely come in handy.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">find</code> function is used to find the <strong>first match</strong> of a regular expression in the input. It searches from the start index of the input string.</p>
<p>Let's make the phone number regex even more versatile and see how it all works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val regex = """[+]?[(]?[0-9]{1,4}[)]?[-0-9]*""".toRegex() // phone number template
val matchResult = regex.find("Her phone number is +1-234-567-89-01. You can also call the second one: +1-111-568-01-01")!!
print(matchResult.value) // +1-234-567-89-01</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p> Note that we care about <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/14633" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, null safety is a crucial feature in the language's design that addresses the issue of null references in programming, often referred to as the billion dollar mistake. | In Kotlin, types are non-nullable by default, and if you attempt to assign or return null to a non-nullable variable, the compiler will give an error. To permit a variable to carry a null value, you must declare it as nullable by adding a ? to its type. Kotlin offers several mechanisms to deal with nullable types securely, such as safe call (), elvis operator (), safe casting (), and let function.">null safety</a>. The text may not contain matches at all and the result of <code class="language-kotlin">find()</code> is <code class="language-kotlin">String?</code> so you should use the <code class="language-kotlin">!!</code> operator or the Elvis operator. </p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">findAll</code> function is required if you want to find <strong>all matches</strong>. It returns all suitable substrings at once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val regex = """\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}""".toRegex() // date template in format YYYY-MM-DD 
val matchResult =
    regex.findAll("Harry was born 1980-07-31 in the Godric's Hollow."
                  + "In 1997-12-24, on Christmas Eve, he returned there" 
                  + "for the legendary Gryffindor sword")
for (matches in matchResult) println(matches.value)
//1980-07-31
//1997-12-24</code></pre>
<h5 id="groups">groups</h5>
<p>You can use the <code class="language-kotlin">groups </code>function to retrieve a group's contents by its name for a regular expression match. This is useful when you want to access the results of regular expression matches belonging to a particular capture group. Here is an example with a regular expression containing three capture groups: city, state, and areaCode. You can use these group names to access the matched values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val regex = """\b(?&lt;city&gt;[A-Za-z\s]+),\s(?&lt;state&gt;[A-Z]{2}):\s(?&lt;areaCode&gt;[0-9]{5})\b""".toRegex()
val input = "Coordinates: Madrid, SP: 28080"

val match = regex.find(input)!!
println(match.groups["city"]?.value)
// Madrid
println(match.groups["state"]?.value)
// SP
println(match.groups["areaCode"]?.value)
// 28080</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have considered the use of regular expressions with the <code class="language-kotlin">replace()</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">split()</code> methods and studied examples of this approach. This offers us more versatile tools for working with text.</p>
<p>And now — good luck with the tasks!</p>
