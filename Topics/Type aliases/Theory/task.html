<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>In previous topics, we discussed <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15352" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a generic class is a class that is parameterized over a type, allowing you to create reusable and flexible code. | To declare a generic class, you specify the type parameter inside angle brackets after the class name. This type parameter can represent any type, and the class declaration does not depend on the specific type. This means that the same class can be used with different data types, making the code more abstract and reusable. The type parameter is determined when you create an instance of the class or invoke a method.">generic classes</a>. We have mentioned that generics can accept any type of parameter and make it possible to reuse some code. But sometimes, the names of generics may get excessively long, which makes it harder to read the code.</p>
<p>In such situations, <strong>type aliases</strong> may help us improve code readability. Let's take a look at what they are and how they work.</p>
<h5 id="usage-of-type-aliases">Usage of type aliases</h5>
<p>Type aliases provide alternative names for existing types â€“ both standard types and custom ones. If the type name is too long, it's a good idea to introduce a different shorter name and use the new one instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class ClassWithVeryLongName{}
typealias SomeClass = ClassWithVeryLongName
</code></pre>
<p>Also, type aliases can be used if you want to emphasize the type, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">typealias Password = String
val myPassword: Password = "hyperskill"</code></pre>
<p>Here we point out that "hyperskill" is a specific kind of string (a password), not just a common <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. </p>
<p>Remember that type aliases should be top level! You cannot place them inside classes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Pet {
    typealias Kitten = Pet.Kitten
    class Kitten {
        // compile error: nested and local type aliases are not supported
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>An alternative to type aliases are <strong>import aliases</strong>. If you're working with a long class name (especially, if you have package names within the class name), you can use import aliases to shorten it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import Pet.Kitten as Kitten</code></pre>
<h5 id="the-principle-of-usage">The principle of usage</h5>
<p>You should remember that type aliases don't introduce new types. They are equivalent to the corresponding original types.</p>
<p>With type aliases, you can still use the fields and methods of the original type. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">typealias Kitten = Pet.Kitten
class Pet {
    class Kitten(name: String) {
        var kittenName = name
        fun getName(): String {
            return kittenName
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    var kitten: Kitten = Kitten("Fluffy")
    println(kitten.getName()) // Fluffy
    println(kitten.getName().length) // 6
}</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to be worried that using type aliases can lead to some errors during runtime: compile time checks take care of that.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var kitten: Kitten = Kitten(6)/* compile-time error: The integer literal does not conform to the 
                                     expected type String*/</code></pre>
<p>Thus, you will be warned that the type of the passed argument (<code class="language-kotlin">Integer</code>) doesn't match the expected type (<code class="language-kotlin">String</code>).</p>
<p>Also, you should always make sure that you really need type aliases and that they will really make your code more understandable.</p>
<h5 id="usage-with-generics">Usage with generics</h5>
<p>You can provide type aliases for generic classes as well as non-generic ones. And of course, you can use the original type fields and methods without any restrictions. </p>
<p>In <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15352" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, generic programming is a way of writing more abstract and reusable code by using type parameters in a class or function. | A generic class is declared with one or more type parameters in angle brackets after the class name, and these type parameters can be used in the class body for field types, method arguments, and return values.

The class itself does not depend on the type it operates on; the type only matters when creating an instance of the class. Generic programming allows you to write reusable code that can operate with objects of different types, as long as they are compatible with the type parameter. In Kotlin, generic types are defined using the `&lt; &gt;` symbols, and the identifier for the generic type can be any letter or word.">generic types</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">typealias DessertBox&lt;T&gt; = BoxForSomeDessert&lt;T&gt;

class BoxForSomeDessert&lt;T&gt;(var dessert: T) {
    fun getDessertFromBox(): T {
        return dessert
    }
}

class Tart(var name: String) {}

fun main() {
    var tartBox = DessertBox(Tart("tastytart"))
    println(tartBox.getDessertFromBox().name) // tastytart
}</code></pre>
<p>When you declare a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15352" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a type alias is a alternative name given to an existing type, which can be a standard type or a custom one. | It is used to improve code readability, especially when the original type name is excessively long or not descriptive enough.

<h5 id="naming-type-aliases">Naming type aliases</h5>
<p>Try to define readable and meaningful type aliases so that other programmers can understand your code. Let's take a look at two examples: a bad one and a good one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">/* bad example */
typealias SomeClass = HashMap&lt;Int, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;

/* good example */
typealias FileTable = MutableMap&lt;Int, MutableList&lt;File&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In the first example, we can't really understand the use of <code class="language-kotlin">SomeClass</code> and the type name is too vague. The second case is much better because we see that <code class="language-kotlin">FileTable</code> is a synonym of a class that defines a list of some files.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Type aliases allow you to shorten long generic names, but they don't introduce new types. They can improve the readability of your code if you use them wisely. Always ask yourself whether using a type alias will make your code more understandable.</p>
