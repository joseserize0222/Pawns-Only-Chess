<h5 id="large-numbers-in-kotlin">Large numbers in Kotlin</h5>
<p>Sometimes programmers have to work with extremely large numbers. Since standard primitive types cannot store them, there are two special classes for this purpose: <strong>BigInteger</strong> for integer numbers and <strong>BigDecimal</strong> for <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a floating-point number is a type of number that can represent real numbers with a high degree of precision. | It is a 64-bit data type, represented by the keyword 'double', that can store a wide range of decimal values, both positive and negative. Floating-point numbers are essential for mathematical operations that involve decimal values. They are used to represent real numbers in programming and are different from whole numbers, which are represented by the 'Int' type in Kotlin.">floating-point numbers</a>.</p>
<p>You're already familiar with <code class="language-kotlin">BigInteger</code>, and in this topic, we are going to look at <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>.</p>
<p>Both classes are provided by Java Class Library. The size of numbers isn't really limited by anything but the physical memory of your computer. In the case of <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>, you can have as many digits after the point as you want, which is important for accurate calculations. There are programs where the accuracy of computation is critical, for example, aircraft or medical software, or storing and processing sums of money, to name a few.</p>
<h5 id="creating-objects-of-bigdecimal">Creating objects of BigDecimal</h5>
<p>To create an instance of <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>, the first thing you need to do is import this class from the <code class="language-kotlin">java.math</code> package using the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.math.BigDecimal</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you have several different options to create a <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>: let's look at a couple of them. The first way is creating it from the <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> object and specifying the desired number in double-quotes. And you can immediately convert the input string to <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val firstBigDecimal = BigDecimal("10000000000000.5897654329")
val secondBigDecimal = BigDecimal(readln()) // Store the input number</code></pre>
<p>The second option is creating it from <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val bigDecimal = BigDecimal(10000000000000.5897654329)</code></pre>
<p> You can convert numbers of other types to <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number = 100000.50000
val bigDecimal = number.toBigDecimal()</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, that syntax is consistent and pretty simple. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the class <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> has several useful constants, just like <code class="language-kotlin">BigInteger</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val zero = BigDecimal.ZERO // 0
val one = BigDecimal.ONE   // 1
val ten = BigDecimal.TEN   // 10</code></pre>
<h5 id="arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic operations</h5>
<p>It is extremely important to keep in mind that <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> is an <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable is a type of object or variable that, once initialized, cannot be changed. | This helps ensure the integrity of data and prevents unintended modifications. For example, a list of pages in a book may be an immutable collection, where the content cannot be altered over time. In contrast, a mutable collection allows for changes to be made, such as adding, removing, or updating stored items. Immutable variables, declared using the `val` keyword, are particularly useful for exposing internal state in a safe and controlled manner, as they cannot be modified by external code.">immutable</a></strong> class. Immutability implies that you cannot change an existing instance of <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>, even if it was declared with the <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a>. If you try to modify an existing object, it is created again.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Remember: <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> numbers are immutable.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>You might remember that in the case of <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code>, there are a few potential problems with the floating point representation. For instance, the result of adding <code class="language-kotlin">0.2</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">0.1</code> won't be <code class="language-kotlin">0.3</code>, which affects the accuracy of further calculations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(0.1 + 0.2) // 0.30000000000000004</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> has no such problem: the results of all the operations will be absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Binary and unary operations are available for <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>. In the code snippet below, you can see some examples of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a binary operation is an operation that takes two operands and applies some computation to them. | In the context of the provided text, the binary operations refer to the arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (\*). These operators take two numbers as operands and return a new number as the result of the operation. The text also mentions other binary operations, such as logical operators (&amp;&amp;, , and ^), which take boolean operands and return a boolean value based on the operands' logical relationship. For example, the &amp;&amp; operator returns true if both operands are true, while the  operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. Furthermore, the text explains that the order of operations (precedence) determines how the operands are grouped in the absence of parentheses. For instance, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator, meaning that the expression 2 + 3 \* 4 will be evaluated as 2 + (3 \* 4) rather than (2 + 3) \* 4.">binary operations</a> with <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code>: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val first = BigDecimal("0.2")
val second = BigDecimal("0.1")

val addition = first + second   // 0.3
val subtraction = first - second   // 0.1
val multiplication = first * second // 0.02
val division = first / second   // 2.0
val remainder = first % second // 0.0</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's take a look at some unary operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var first = BigDecimal("0.2")

// decrement
val decrement = --first //  -0.8
// increment
val increment = ++first //  0.2
// unary minus, turning to opposite sign
val reverse = -first  //  -0.2
// absolute value
val module = first.abs()  //  0.2
// raise to the power, works only with Int
val power = first.pow(3) </code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to use increment (<code class="language-kotlin">++</code>) and decrement (<code class="language-kotlin">--</code>) operators in their postfix forms.</p>
<h5 id="rounding-control">Rounding control</h5>
<p>When we need to tweak the accuracy (the number of digits after the point), <code class="language-kotlin">setScale()</code> comes to the rescue. It allows us to adjust the precision of large fractional numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">bigDecimal.setScale(newScale, RoundingMode)</code></pre>
<p>The first parameter is <code class="language-kotlin">newScale</code>. It sets the number of digits after the decimal point. You may receive the scale of your number this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val fractionalNumber= 1234.5678.toBigDecimal()
println(fractionalNumber.scale()) // 4</code></pre>
<p>The second parameter — <code class="language-kotlin">roundingMode</code>— allows us to manage the rounding mode. To use it, you need to perform the import:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.math.RoundingMode</code></pre>
<p>The table below lists all the possible <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> rounding modes along with their brief descriptions: </p>
<p><picture><img alt="table with all possible BigDecimal rounding modes along with their short descriptions" height="767" src="https://ucarecdn.com/c1a3822c-c3aa-4b17-9584-60367e93069e/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p>This might seem a little abstract, so let's look at some examples that will help sort things out.</p>
<h5 id="rounding-mode-examples">Rounding mode examples</h5>
<p>So, you can adjust the accuracy of your large numbers and choose the rules by which they will be rounded. The following code snippet shows some examples of using <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> rounding with a few different rounding modes:  </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var bigDecimal = BigDecimal("100.5649")
println(bigDecimal.setScale(3, RoundingMode.CEILING))   // 100.565

bigDecimal = BigDecimal("0.55")
println(bigDecimal.setScale(1, RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN)) // 0.5
println(bigDecimal.setScale(3, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY)) // 0.550</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> numbers are immutable, so it is not enough to simply apply <code class="language-kotlin">setScale()</code> in order for the number to retain the new value after rounding. You need to assign:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var bigDecimal = BigDecimal("999999999999999999.99999999999999")
bigDecimal.setScale(3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
println(bigDecimal) // 999999999999999999.99999999999999

bigDecimal = bigDecimal.setScale(3, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
println(bigDecimal) // 1000000000000000000.000</code></pre>
<p>The table below illustrates the difference in behavior depending on rounding modes. You'll be able to easily compare them:</p>

<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Note that <code class="language-kotlin">UNNECESSARY</code> will add insignificant zeros to the number if you specified too many digits in <code class="language-kotlin">setScale()</code>. But if you specify too few digits, an error will occur. </p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="rounding-in-arithmetic-operations">Rounding in arithmetic operations</h5>
<p>Finally, let's discuss something a little more advanced: at this point, you should have enough background knowledge for that.</p>
<p>Let's talk about determining the accuracy of the result of division. The scale of the result is the same as the scale of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a dividend is a number that is being divided by another number, called the divisor, in the process of division. | In the Euclidean division formula, the dividend is represented as the product of the divisor and the quotient, added to the remainder. For example, if the dividend is 16 and the divisor is 5, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 1, as calculated by the formula: 16 = 5 * 3 + 1. This concept applies to both positive and negative numbers.">dividend</a>, and by default, <code class="language-kotlin">RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN</code> is used. However, you can specify the scale manually if necessary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val dividend = BigDecimal("0.9865745")
val divisor = BigDecimal("3.543")

var quotient = dividend / divisor    // 0.2784574
quotient = dividend.setScale(4, RoundingMode.CEILING)/ divisor   // 0.2785</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at another example. Say we need to divide an integer <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> by something, and as a result, we want to get a fractional number. In such situations, it's important to clearly indicate the scale of the dividend:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val intDividend = BigDecimal("10")
val divisor = BigDecimal("3")

var quotient = intDividend / divisor    // 3
quotient = intDividend.setScale(4, RoundingMode.CEILING)/ divisor   // 3.3333</code></pre>
<p>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication have no such specificities. Although precision is also a thing there and it is used in <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations performed on numerical values using specific operators. | There are five arithmetic operators in Kotlin: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulo (%). These operators are binary, meaning they take two operands, which are the values or variables the operator is being applied to. For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands, and + is the operator. Arithmetic operations in Kotlin follow specific rules, such as multiplication having a higher priority than addition or subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and simplify notation. Additionally, Kotlin supports compound assignment operations that combine arithmetic operations and assignment, such as assignment after addition (a += b) and assignment after subtraction (a -= b).">arithmetic operations</a>, it's quite intuitive:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val first = BigDecimal("7.7777")
val second = BigDecimal("3.3")

val addition = first + second   // 11.0777; The result scale is 4 (max of the scales)
val subtraction = first - second   // 4.4777; The result scale is 4 (max of the scales)
val multiplication = first * second // 25.66641; The result scale is 5 (sum of the scales)</code></pre>
<p>So, for these operations, we can describe the accuracy of the result as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Addition</strong>: the maximum scale of the addends;</p></li><li><p><strong>Subtraction</strong>: the maximum scale of the minuend and subtrahend;</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiplication</strong>: the sum of the multiplier and multiplicand scales;</p></li><li><p><strong>Division</strong>: the scale of the dividend.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> class is useful for storing large fractional numbers. Standard arithmetic operations are also available for <code class="language-kotlin">BigDecimal</code> numbers. You can manage the behavior of objects of this class when rounded with <code class="language-kotlin">setScale()</code>: indicate the desired number of digits as the first parameter and the rounding mode as the second parameter.</p>
