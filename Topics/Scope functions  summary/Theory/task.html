<p>We have already figured out how <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/23478" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, scope functions are a group of non-extension functions (let, run, with, also, and apply) that return lambda calculation and are used for grouping function calls. | They help you work with the safety call operator or introduce an expression as a variable in a local scope.

It allows you to invoke functions and access properties of the object in a more concise and readable way. The context object is available inside the function or lambda expression and it returns the result of the lambda expression. It is useful in two major cases: initializing a new object and passing the result of a lambda to it, and using a function without an extension.">context object</a>. Now it's time to cut this famous "Kotlinian knot"! We will learn how to choose the right function and why we need these two similar keywords: <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">this</code>. Let's get started!</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-difference-result-of-functions">What is the difference: result of functions</h5>
<p>There is an important difference between the scope functions, which greatly influences our choice of the most appropriate one.</p>
<p>1. <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">also</code> return context objects.</p>
<p>2. <code class="language-kotlin">let</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">run</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">with</code> return a lambda result.</p>
<p>With <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">also</code>, we change the original context object and can make a long chain of functions around it. It's called side steps.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val numbers = mutableListOf&lt;Int&gt;()
    numbers.also { println("Let's add some elements in this list") }
        .apply {
            add(2)
            add(3)
            add(1)
        }
        .also { println("And now let's sort these elements in the list") }
        .sort() // also() and sort() get as a parameter our changed context object - numbers
    println(numbers)
}</code></pre>
<p>We performed all these operations on the same object, our <code class="language-kotlin">mutableList()</code>. An alternative way is using <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">also</code> with return. In this case, we can decide what we want to return.</p>
<p>Unlike the case in the first example, <code class="language-kotlin">let</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">run</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">with</code> return some result, and as a result Kotlin takes the last <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/23478" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. | It can be a simple literal value, a variable, a function call, or a more complex combination of these elements using operators or other language constructs. Expressions are used to compute and return values from functions, assign values to variables, and perform calculations or operations in conditionals. For example, 2 \* 2 is an expression, and it produces a single value.">expression</a> in the function's body. Therefore, we can assign the result of these functions to a variable or make a long chain and transform different data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val numbers = mutableListOf&lt;Int&gt;(2, 6, 8, 9, 74)
    val bigNumbers = numbers.run {
        add(15) // Remember that run uses this
        add(5)
        count { it &gt; 10 }
    } // If you put here another method or function, it will receive as a parameter the result of the last expression, the number of elements greater than ten
    println("There are $bigNumbers numbers greater than ten")
}</code></pre>
<p>Another way to use these functions is making a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/23478" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a temporary scope is a concept related to scope functions, which are used to organize code and execute operations in the context of an object. | These functions create a temporary scope for the object and allow you to communicate with the object using keywords such as `it` or `this` within the lambda expression. This syntax can make the code look similar to a domain-specific language (DSL), improving code readability and maintainability. However, it is important to use scope functions judiciously, as excessive use can make the code harder to understand and maintain.">temporary scope</a> for a variable, performing some actions, getting the results, and forgetting about it like a little guppy fish forgets that it already had lunch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val numbers = mutableListOf&lt;Int&gt;(2, 6, 8, 9, 74)
    with(numbers) {
        val firstNum = first() // Remember that with uses this
        val lastNum = last()
        println("First element is $firstNum, last element is $lastNum")
    }
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="what-is-the-difference-context-object">What is the difference: context object</h5>
<p>In terms of scope functions, there are five practical differences between <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">it</code>. </p>
<ol><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">this</code> refers directly to the context object, while <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> can refer to separate members of the object on which we invoke a scope function.</p></li><li><p>In both cases, we refer to some object with which we will work, but with <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> we can pass several parameters, while with <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> we're dealing with one function parameter. </p></li><li><p>We can omit <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> in a function and access the arguments or object methods directly, but in the case of <code class="language-kotlin">it</code>, we have to call arguments and parameters with the <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> keyword.</p></li><li><p>With <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> we can rename our parameters and use a more appropriate name inside the function.</p></li><li><p>If you have only one function in the body and <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> as a parameter, you can replace that with the <code class="language-kotlin">::</code> reference to the function.</p></li></ol>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">run</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">with</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code> work with <code class="language-kotlin">this</code>, while <code class="language-kotlin">let</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">also</code> work with <code class="language-kotlin">it</code>. Let's see some simple examples.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class Musician(var name: String, var instrument: String = "Guitar", var band: String = "Radiohead")

fun main() {
    Musician("Jonny Greenwood").apply {
      instrument = "harmonica" // here we can use this.instrument
      band = "Pavement"
     
    }

    Musician("Jonny Greenwood").also {
      it.instrument = "harmonica"
    }

    Musician("Dave Glowl", "Drums", "Nirvana").let { (musicianName, instr, newBand) -&gt;
        musicianName.length + instr.length + newBand.count { it == 'a' }
    }
    // With it, we can pass several parameters and use them as separate parameter members. We can also rename these parameters
}</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Don't get scared: the use of <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> is almost the same, we only show their technical differences. In practice, they can play similar roles and you can choose the most suitable way.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now, look at <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html#function-selection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the table</a>, which summarizes the differences between scope functions.</p>

<h5 id="function-selection">Function selection</h5>
<p>Once again, like in the previous topic, you might think: "Hey, I can receive the same result if I, for example, replace <code class="language-kotlin">run</code> with <code class="language-kotlin">let</code> and add the word <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> to a parameter inside the function body. And I can replace <code class="language-kotlin">run</code> with <code class="language-kotlin">with</code>." Indeed, in many cases you can do so.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>And here is a cool thing: you can define your own rules for scope function usage in your team.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Why is it cool? Because you will know: ok, if I see <code class="language-kotlin">run</code>, I understand that we use it for certain purposes. You see it and you immediately understand: yes, this piece of code does the job! And that is the beauty and purpose of scope functions: they can help you make code more readable and clear. We can say that scope functions are primarily semantic elements.</p>
<p>However, Kotlin language creators give us the following recommendations (they refer to them in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#scope-functions-apply-with-run-also-let" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kotlin coding conventions</a>):</p>
<ul><li><p>Executing a lambda on non-null objects: <code class="language-kotlin">let</code></p></li><li><p>Introducing an expression as a variable in <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/23478" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a local is a variable that is declared in a local scope, typically within a function or a block of code. | It is only accessible within that scope and cannot be accessed from outside of it. This is in contrast to top-level variables, which are declared at the top-level of a file and are accessible from anywhere in the program. Local variables are often used in conjunction with scope functions like `let` and `run`, which allow you to work with a value in a limited scope and improve code readability.">local</a> scope: <code class="language-kotlin">let</code></p></li><li><p>Object configuration: <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code></p></li><li><p>Object configuration and computing the result: <code class="language-kotlin">run</code></p></li><li><p>Running statements where an expression is required: non-extension <code class="language-kotlin">run</code></p></li><li><p>Additional effects: <code class="language-kotlin">also</code></p></li><li><p>Grouping function calls on an object: <code class="language-kotlin">with</code></p></li></ul>
<p>In our two previous topics about scope functions, we already used these official recommendations in our examples.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We have considered an important and complicated topic – how to use scope functions. Why is it so important? Because you will certainly encounter these functions in real practice no matter what you work on: Android apps, Kotlin backend, or something else. So, here's what we've learned:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can define use cases for different scope functions in your team.</p></li><li><p>You can skip the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> but must use <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> as a reference to your context object in scope functions.</p></li><li><p>Knowing that different scope functions return different results, you can make function chains. However, be careful with chains: scope functions must make code more readable, while long chains make it more confusing.</p></li></ul>
