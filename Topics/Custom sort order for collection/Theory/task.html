<p>In previous lessons, we have learned to order collections based on the methods defined in the <code class="language-kotlin">Comparator</code> interface and the <code class="language-kotlin">compareTo()</code> method following the intrinsic natural order of elements.</p>
<p>In this topic, we will see how to customize the order of a collection based on our needs or tasks with the help of special methods defined in Kotlin.</p>
<h5 id="custom-order">Custom order</h5>
<p>To perform<strong> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/22706" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, custom sorting refers to the process of defining a new order for sorting elements in a collection. | This can be done by creating a custom order for non-comparable elements or properties. The interface is used to define a method that returns an integer result of the comparison between two values. A zero indicates that the arguments are equal, a negative number indicates that the first argument is less than the second, and a positive number indicates that the first argument is greater than the second. This allows you to set the desired order in a collection. A lambda function can be used to define the function, for example, to return a positive number if the first element should precede the second, or if a date, string, etc. should precede another based on specific criteria.">custom sorting</a> </strong>of the elements in a collection and order the elements of any type in a way you like, Kotlin offers the following functions: <code class="language-kotlin">sortedBy()</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">sortedByDescending()</code>. </p>
<p>How do they work? They take a <strong>lambda </strong>as the<strong> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/22706" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a selector function is a function used in conjunction with special methods to perform tasks such as finding the minimum or maximum value in a collection. | Selector functions are used as a substitute for methods that would throw an exception if the collection is empty. Instead, when the collection is empty, selector functions return a null value. This is an evolution of previous methods that would throw an exception in such cases. Selector functions can be used to return the smallest or largest return value of the selector itself, or the element with the smallest or largest value. It is important to note the difference between a selector function and a reduction function.">selector function</a></strong>, which maps the element or some properties of the element into comparable attributes. As a result, it returns an ordered collection following the identified natural order. <code class="language-kotlin">sortedBy()</code> returns a collection where the elements are sorted in ascending order, and <code class="language-kotlin">sortedByDescending()</code> returns a collection in descending order. </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val words = listOf("peter", "anne", "michael", "caroline")

    // sorted by word length
    println(words.sortedBy { it.length }) // [anne, peter, michael, caroline]
    println(words.sortedByDescending { it.length }) // [caroline, michael, peter, anne]

    // sorted by first letter
    println(words.sortedBy { it.first() }) // [anne, caroline, michael, peter]
    println(words.sortedByDescending { it.first() }) // [peter, michael, caroline, anne]

    // sorted by the last letter
    println(words.sortedBy { it.last() }) // [anne, caroline, michael, peter]
    println(words.sortedByDescending { it.last() }) // [peter, michael, anne, caroline]

<h5 id="define-new-order">Define new order</h5>
<p>Sometimes, natural order is not enough, and you need to implement a more specific order to work with the elements of a collection; for example, you can implement a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/22706" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a custom order, also known as custom sorting, refers to the process of ordering the elements in a collection based on specific criteria that you define. | This is different from the intrinsic natural order of elements. To implement custom sorting, Kotlin provides special methods that take a lambda function as a selector function. This selector function maps the element or some property of the element into a comparable attribute. As a result, it returns an ordered collection that follows the identified natural order or the custom order you have set based on your specific needs or tasks.">custom order</a> for non-comparable elements or properties. </p>
<p>We can define custom sorting using the <code class="language-kotlin">Comparator</code> interface. The <code class="language-kotlin">Comparator</code> interfaces helps us to define the <code class="language-kotlin">compare()</code> method, which returns the integer result of the comparison between two values: a zero if the arguments are equal, a negative number if the first argument is less than the second, or a positive number if the first argument is greater than the second. In this way, you can set the order that you need in a collection. We can define the <code class="language-kotlin">compare()</code> function using a lambda, for example, to return a positive number if the first element must precede the second, if a date must precede another date, if a string must precede another string according to the string length, and so on.</p>
<p>Now we can use the <code class="language-kotlin">sortedWith()</code> function to return a list of all elements sorted according to the specified <strong>comparator</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val words = listOf("peter", "anne", "michael", "caroline")

    // define a comparator for the list of words
    val wordsLengthComparator = Comparator { str1: String, str2: String -&gt; str1.length - str2.length }
    // Ordered list according to the comparator
    println(words.sortedWith(wordsLengthComparator)) // [anne, peter, michael, caroline]
    
    // another comparator using the middle letter
    val middleLetterComparator =
        Comparator { str1: String, str2: String -&gt; str1[str1.length / 2] - str2[str2.length / 2] }
    
    // Ordered list according to the comparator
    println(words.sortedWith(middleLetterComparator)) // [michael, caroline, anne, peter]
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="improving-your-custom-order">Improving your custom order</h5>
<p>Another alternative way to accomplish this task is to use the <code class="language-kotlin">compare()</code> function, which allows us to define on the fly the comparator that we need using a <strong>lambda function </strong>to customize the sorting of the elements in a collection with <code class="language-kotlin">sortedWith()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val words = listOf("peter", "anne", "michael", "caroline")

    // ordering by length
    println(words.sortedWith(compareBy { it.length })) // [anne, peter, michael, caroline]
    
    // ordering by middle letter
    println(words.sortedWith(compareBy { it[it.length / 2] })) // [michael, caroline, anne, peter]

}</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can combine your custom ordering method with the <code class="language-kotlin">reversed()</code> function to obtain the inverse form of the defined order.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val words = listOf("peter", "anne", "michael", "caroline")

    // ordering by length reversed
    println(words.sortedWith(compareBy { it.length }).reversed()) // [caroline, michael, peter, anne]
    
    // ordering by middle letter reversed
    println(words.sortedWith(compareBy { it[it.length / 2] }).reversed()) // [peter, anne, caroline, michael]


}</code></pre>

<p>Throughout this topic, we have shown different techniques to customize the ordering of elements in a collection. Now you will be able to adapt ordering to the requirements of your problem based on a specific natural order or setting your own comparison criteria.</p>
